    <h3>Potion, <em>Very Rare</em></h3>
    <p>A jar that seems empty, yet bears a discernible weight to it. A creature can spend their bonus action to inhale the contents of this jar, gaining the following effects:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You have an additional failure box on your death saving throws.</li>
        <li>As a bonus action when a creature is making death saving throws within 5 feet of you, you can go prone and give them advantage on their next death saving throw.</li>
        <li>If a creature dies within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to give them your last breath. If you do so, you lose the effects of this item and you always have one failed death saving throw. The creature then regains a number of hit points equal to half of their hit point maximum.</li>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Fallen Star</button>
    <div class="content">
    <h3>Wondrous Item, <em>Very Rare</em></h3>
    <p>The star resembles a lustrous blue moonstone less than 1 foot in diameter, and those who look upon it feel a strange sense of nostalgia. During a short rest, one creature can engage in a process similar to attunement in which they align with the star. Up to 6 people may be aligned with the star at any given time. Whenever a creature aligned to the star fails an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw within 120 feet of the star, the star gains one charge and gains an additional charge on a critical failure. While the star has 20 or more charges, a creature aligned with the stone can use it to add 10 to their roll. The stone then loses all of its charges.</p>

    <div class="content">
    <h3>Weapon (Mace), <em>Very Rare</em></h3>
    <em>(requires attunement)</em>
    <p>The mace is built from a sturdy, lightweight mithral grip and is topped with a spherical, cloudy moonstone. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this mace, and it additionally has the finesse property and is considered silver for the purpose of overcoming resistances and immunities.</p>
    <p><strong>Lunar Charges.</strong> Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher while attuned to the mace, it gains a number of lunar charges equal to the spell slot level. You gain a bonus to your AC and saving throws equal to half of your lunar charges, rounded down.  While holding the mace, you can spend any number of charges to reroll that many damage dice when you deal radiant damage with this mace or with a leveled spell. </p>
    <p>The mace can store no more than 7 charges, and it loses all stored charges at the end of a long rest.</p>
    <p><strong>Crescent Strike.</strong> When you hit with a melee attack using it, you can expend up to 3 lunar charges. For each charge you expend, the target takes an extra 1d6 radiant damage.</p>

    <div class="content">
    <h3>Wondrous Item, <em>Rare</em></h3>
    <p>You can designate a willing equine creature within 5 feet of you to be permitted entry into your horse pocket, doing so on their turn. The pocket is a private demiplane of a comfortable size for the creature, and the creature can stick their head out of the pocket at any point. Any equipment that the creature was carrying will go with them, but no objects other than their equipment can go inside of the pocket, and any other creatures that may have been smuggled in via bag of holding or similar items are teleported outside of the horse pocket to the nearest safe location. A creature can use their bonus action to get the equine creature out of the pocket.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Necromancer&#39;s Bag of Tricks</button>
    <div class="content">
    <h3>Wondrous Item, <em>Uncommon</em></h3>
    <p>This ordinary bag made from black cloth appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, bony object. The bag weighs 1/2 pound.</p>
    <p>You can use an action to pull the bony object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table. The creature vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.</p>
    <p>The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.</p>
    <p>Once three bony objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can&#39;t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
    <p>When you pull from the bag, you can make a DC 10+[the d8 number] <em class="skillcheck">Intelligence (Arcana)</em> check to pull a specific result out of the bag. On a failure, the creature you summon becomes hostile towards you.</p>

    <h3>Wondrous Item, <em>Rare</em></h3>
    <p>A small jar containing a fine power of ash collected from an Ocrian blue mangrove tree in a ritual process. This highly sought-after material has a number of uses:</p>
