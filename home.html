<button type="button" class="collapsible"><s>Champion&#39;s Talisman</s></button>
<div class="content">
    <h3>Wondrous Item, <em>Common</em></h3>
    <em>(requires attunement)</em>
  <p>While attuned to this talisman, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Crawling Cloak</button>
<div class="content">
    <h3>Wondrous Item, <em>Common</em></h3>
  <p>This unusual cloak is made of many overlapping, broad strips of thick cloth.</p>
   <p>When you are prone, you can animate the cloak and have it pull you along the ground, allowing you to ignore the extra movement cost for crawling. You can still only move up to your normal movement rate and can&#39;t stand up from prone unless you still have at least half your movement remaining after moving.</p> 
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Crusader&#39;s Shield</button>
<div class="content">
    <h3>Armor (shield), <em>Common</em></h3> 
    <em>(requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)</em>
  <p>A bronze boss is set in the center of this round shield. When you attune to the shield, the boss changes shape, becoming a symbol of your divine connection: a holy symbol for a cleric or paladin or an engraving of mistletoe or other sacred plant for a druid. You can use the shield as a spellcasting focus for your spells.</p>
  <p><strong>Versatile Cantrip.</strong> While holding the shield, you can try to cast a cantrip that you don&#39;t know. The cantrip must be on your spell list, and you must make a DC 10 <em class="skillcheck">Intelligence (Religion)</em> check. If the check succeeds, you cast the spell. If the check fails, so does the spell, and the action used to cast the spell is wasted. In either case, you can&#39;t use this property again until you finish a long rest.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Deepchill Orb</button>
<div class="content">
    <h3>Wondrous Item, <em>Common</em></h3>
  <p>This fist-sized sphere of blue quartz emits cold. If placed in a container with a capacity of up to 5 cubic feet, it keeps the internal temperature of the container at a consistent 40 degrees Fahrenheit. This can keep liquids chilled, preserve cooked foods for up to 1 week, raw meats for up to 3 days, and fruits and vegetables for weeks. If you hold the orb without gloves or other insulating method, you take 1 cold damage each minute you hold it. At the GM&#39;s discretion, the orb&#39;s cold can be applied to other uses, such as keeping it in contact with a hot item to cool down the item enough to be handled, wrapping it and using it as a cooling pad to bring down fever or swelling, or similar.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible"><s>Earrings of the Storm Oyster</s></button>
<div class="content">
    <h3>Wondrous Item, <em>Very Rare</em></h3>
    <em>(requires attunement)</em>
  <p>The deep blue pearls forming the core of these earrings come from oysters that survive being struck by lightning. While wearing these earrings, you gain the following benefits:
    </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You have resistance to lightning and thunder
    damage.</li>
    <li>
      You can understand Primordial. When it is spoken,
      the pearls echo the words in a language you can
      understand, at a whisper only you can hear.
    </li>
    <li>You can&#39;t be deafened.</li>
    <li>You can breathe air and water.</li>
    <li>
      As an action, you can cast the <em class="spell">sleet storm</em> spell (save
      DC 15) from the earrings. The earrings can&#39;t be
      used this way again until the next dawn.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Lockbreaker</button>
<div class="content">
    <h3>Weapon (dagger), <em>Common</em></h3>
  <p>You can use this stiletto-bladed dagger to open locks by using an action and making a <em class="skillcheck">Strength check</em>. The DC is 5 less than the DC to pick the lock (minimum DC 10). On a success, the lock is broken.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible"><s>Master Angler&#39;s Tackle</s></button>
<div class="content">
    <h3>Wondrous Item, <em>Common</em></h3>
  <p>This is a set of well-worn but finely crafted fishing gear. You have advantage on any <em class="skillcheck">Wisdom (Survival)</em> checks made to catch fish or other seafood when using it. If you ever roll a 1 on your check while using the tackle, roll again. If the second roll is a 20, you still fail to catch anything edible, but you pull up something interesting or valuable â€” a bottle with a note in it, a fragment of an ancient tablet carved in ancient script, a mermaid in need of help, or similar. The GM decides what you pull up and its value, if it has one.
    </p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible"><s>Pocket Spark</s></button>
<div class="content">
    <h3>Wondrous Item, <em>Common</em></h3>
  <p>What looks like a simple snuff box contains a magical, glowing ember. Though warm to the touch, the ember can be handled without damage. It can be used to ignite flammable materials quickly. Using it to light a torch, lantern, or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel takes a bonus action. Lighting any other fire takes an action. The ember is consumed when used. If the ember is consumed, the box creates a new ember at dawn.
    </p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Pole of Great Lengths</button>
<div class="content">
    <h3>Weapon (quarterstaff), <em>Rare</em></h3>
    <em>(requires attunement)</em>
  <p>Resembling a quarterstaff with caps of excellent make, the shaft itself has very little in the way of design or grips. You gain a +1 bonus to attack or damage rolls made using this quarterstaff.</p>
  <p><strong>Change Size.</strong> As a bonus action, the staff&#39;s length can be changed to be as small as 3 inches or as long as 30 feet. A pole shorter than 1 foot and longer than 10 feet is considered an improvised weapon, and a pole longer than 15 feet makes attacks at disadvantage.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Potion of Skating</button>
<div class="content">
    <h3>Potion, <em>Common</em></h3>
  <p>For 1 hour after you drink this potion, you can move across icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check, and difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn&#39;t cost you extra movement. This sparkling blue liquid contains tiny snowflakes that disappear when shaken.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Prospecting Compass</button>
<div class="content">
    <h3>Wondrous Item, <em>Common</em></h3>
  <p>This battered, old compass has engravings of lumps of ore and natural crystalline minerals. While holding this compass, you can use an action to name a type of metal or stone. The compass points to the nearest naturally occurring source of that metal or stone for 1 hour or until you name a different type of metal or stone. The compass can point to cut gemstones, but it can&#39;t point to processed metals, such as iron swords or gold coins. The compass can&#39;t be used this way again until the next dawn.
    </p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible"><s>Quilted Bridge</s></button>
<div class="content">
    <h3>Wondrous Item, <em>Common</em></h3>
  <p>A practiced hand sewed together a collection of cloth remnants from magical garb to make this colorfuland cozy blanket. You can use an action to unfold it and pour out three drops of wine in tribute to its maker. If you do so, the blanket becomes a 5-foot wide, 10-foot-long bridge as sturdy as steel. You can fold the bridge back up as an action.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible"><s>Ring of the Frog</s></button>
<div class="content">
    <h3>Wondrous Item, <em>Uncommon</em></h3>
    <em>(requires attunement)</em>
  <p>A pale chrysoprase cut into the shape of a frog is the centerpiece of this tarnished copper ring. While wearing this ring, you have a swimming speed of 20 feet, and you can jump three times the normal distance, though you can&#39;t jump farther than your remaining movement would allow.</p>
  <p><strong>Frog Tongue.</strong> You can use an action transform your tongue into one resembling that of a frog or toad for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no action required). You can elongate your tongue out to a distance of 20 feet, and your tongue can pick up or hold an object weighing no more than 10 pounds. To grab an item that is being worn or carried, you must still succeed on a <em class="skillcheck">Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)</em> check, ranged attack, or similar check, as determined by your GM. The tongue retracts into your mouth when not in use and has no impact on your ability to speak or cast spells with verbal components. Once used, this property can&#39;t be used again until the next dawn.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Screaming Skull</button>
<div class="content">
    <h3>Wondrous Item, <em>Common</em></h3>
  <p>This skull looks like a normal animal or humanoid skull. You can use an action to place the skull on the ground, a table, or other surface and activate it with a command word. The skull&#39;s magic triggers when a creature comes within 5 feet of it without speaking that command word. The skull emits a green glow from its eye sockets, shedding dim light in a 15-foot radius, levitates up to 3 feet in the air, and emits a piercing scream for 1 minute that is audible up to 600 feet away. The skull can&#39;t be used this way again until the next dawn.
    The skull has AC 13 and 5 hit points. If destroyed while active, it releases a burst of necromantic energy. Each creature within 5 feet of the skull must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Scythe of the Fell Harvest</button>
<div class="content">
    <h3>Weapon (Halberd), <em>Rare</em></h3>
  <p>This scythe is oversized even for a standard farming scythe, with the shaft decorated with carvings of an ancient battle. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. It has a reach of 10 feet and is sized for a large creature, dealing 2d10 slashing damage on a hit.</p> 
  <p><strong>Dire Cleave.</strong> You may spend a hit die to replace one attack with this weapon with a great cleaving strike. Make one attack roll against each creature within a 15 foot cone. A creature with an AC less than or equal to the result is hit, taking damage per normal, though any bonus damage outside of weapon damage (i.e. Divine Smite) is only applied to one creature.</p>
</div>

<div class="content">

<div class="content">
    <h3>Wondrous Item, <em>Common</em></h3>
  <p>This lacquered wooden spoon carries an entire cupboard within its smooth contours. When you swirl this spoon in any edible mixture, such as a drink, stew, porridge, or other dish, it exudes a flavorful aroma and infuses the mixture.
