        <h1>How do I pay for things?</h1>
        <p>Here at the Ornate Treasury, we do not deal in common currency. Legal tender holds little appeal in the courts of the immortal fey, and they require a more particular intagibility. We call these <strong>Trinkets and Truths</strong>.</p>
        <p>A trinket is an object that can be distinguished from a pile of them. If you cannot differentiate this item from a pile of other similar items, then it is not a trinket. Odd items, sentimental pieces, and many magic items qualify as trinkets.</p>
        <p>A truth is an immaterial property about yourself. The more it is categorized, the less power it holds, and as such we have provided a list of truths that we have observed traded frequently:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Your firstborn child (very famous example; no longer accepted in this establishment)</li>
            <li>Your first victory</li>
            <li>Your silver tongue</li>
            <li>Your last breath</li>
            <li>A relationship</li>
            <li>The sight from an eye</li>
            <li>One day of your life</li>
            <li>A day with your face </li>
            <li>Your welcome</li>
            <li>Your name</li>
            <li>Your home</li>
            <li>A favour</li>
            <li>Your dreams</li>
            <li>Your latest lie</li>
            <li>Your sense of balance</li>
            <li>Your luck</li>
        </ol>
